	Goodbye! 

When I began my project I believed that I need four classes:
1. Driver.java
2.Stack.jave->provided in lecture
3.Student.java
4.Address.java

Driver.java:
it will be the helm of the program as It is pretty much pertaining to everything the user will interect with as well as combining the other files.

-displays menu

Stack.java:
It is what we will use to store the information from the text file and how we will be able to organize it so we can call upon it later.
- called upon for operations 1 & 2
Student.java:
It will be what i use to ring in the text file as I see it as a class for gathering the student data.
-used in operation one to fill the stacks

Address.java: 
not entirely sure what this is meant to be for I am assuming it is meant to check the second address however I feel as though that is only a line + an if statement in the Driver class if your implementing the other classes properly.
-used in printing the stacks
